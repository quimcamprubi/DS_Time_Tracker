Time Tracker Java Application

TimeTracker is a mobile application that stores Tasks and Projects that the user wants to record as well as how much time has been spent on each one of them. It allows for the creation of a structure of Tasks/Projects within Projects, and allows the user to start and stop the desired tasks.
The Java project contains the back-end of the application, which handles all the logic necessary to handle said Tasks and Projects. The front-end of the app was developed using Flutter and can also be found within this repository.
