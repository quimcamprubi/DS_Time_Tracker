First milestone:
  - Create and update class diagram (DSTimeTracker.puml)
  - Create main and debugged and coded until appendix B was completed (half the mark)
  - Coded and debugged to implement PrintTree Visitor
  - Coded some parts of the JSON implementations (such as doing some parses, part of the store and loader, debugging, etc)
  - Coded part of the composite
Second milestone:
  - Running Checkstyle and correct the errors (with Quim).
  - DbC: Helped creating DbC preconditions, invariants and postconditions for Activity and Project.
  - Search By Tag: Created the functionality of Search By Tag.
  
Quim Camprubí Casas 1528104
First milestone:
  - Class design, including patterns and relations between classes
  - Clock: Singleton, Task, Project, Activity: Composite, Interval: Visitor, PrintTree: Visitor, WholePrintTree: Visitor classes implementation
  - Implementation of the JSON loader algorithm
  - Testing of all the main parts of the code (TimeTracker, JSON)
  - Implementation of the update algorithm and data propagation through the tree
Second milestone:
