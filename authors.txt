First milestone:
  - Create and update class diagram (DSTimeTracker.puml)
  - Create main and debugged and coded until appendix B was completed (half the mark)
  - Coded and debugged to implement PrintTree Visitor
  - Coded some parts of the JSON implementations (such as doing some parses, part of the store and loader, debugging, etc)
  - Coded part of the composite
Second milestone:
  - Running Checkstyle and correct the errors (with Quim).
  - DbC: Helped creating DbC preconditions, invariants and postconditions for Activity and Project.
  - Search By Tag: Created the functionality of Search By Tag.
Third milestone:
  - Created and updated the UML diagram.
  - Coded the point 11 (recent tasks) and part of point 7 (search by tag).
  - Helped complete the 9 steps of codelab tutorial.
  - Helped in point 1 and 2 of the milestone.
