  - Coded some parts of the JSON implementations (such as doing some parses, part of the store and loader, debugging, etc)
  - Coded part of the composite
Second milestone:
  - Running Checkstyle and correct the errors (with Quim).
  - DbC: Helped creating DbC preconditions, invariants and postconditions for Activity and Project.
  - Search By Tag: Created the functionality of Search By Tag.
Third milestone:
  - Created and updated the UML diagram.
  - Coded the point 11 (recent tasks) and part of point 7 (search by tag).
  - Helped complete the 9 steps of codelab tutorial.
  - Helped in point 1 and 2 of the milestone.
  
Quim Camprubí Casas 1528104

  - Clock: Singleton, Task, Project, Activity: Composite, Interval: Visitor, PrintTree: Visitor, WholePrintTree: Visitor classes implementation
  - Implementation of the JSON loader algorithm
  - Testing of all the main parts of the code (TimeTracker, JSON)
  - Implementation of the update algorithm and data propagation through the tree
Second milestone:
  - Code inspection improvements. Fixed style of the program after running Checkstyle.
  - DbC: Implementation of Activity invariant function for Tasks and Projects. DbC preconditions, invariants and postconditions for Activity and Project.
  - Search By Tag: Improvements on the Search By Tag algorithm. Case insensitive search.
Third milestone:
  - Completed Flutter Codelab to prepare for the milestone's tasks.
  - Various refactors to use our TimeTracker Java project with the provided WebServer (functionalities findActivityById, toJson, create project and create task).
  - Observer implementation for Tasks and Projects in order to properly update duration in real time. 
  - Developed Tasks 1-6 and 8-10 of the Flutter app. 
  - Helped with the development of tasks 7, 11 and 12.
